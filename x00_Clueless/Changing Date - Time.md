Changing the date and time in the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is necessary to ensure that the system clock is accurate at a fundamental level. This is important for system stability, scheduled tasks, logging, and synchronization with network time servers. Here’s how you can change the date and time in the BIOS/UEFI:

### Accessing BIOS/UEFI

1. **Restart Your Computer**: Begin by restarting your computer.
2. **Enter BIOS/UEFI**: During the initial startup screen (before the operating system loads), press the appropriate key to enter the BIOS/UEFI setup. Common keys include `F2`, `F10`, `Delete`, `Esc`, or `F12`. The specific key to press is usually indicated on the screen during startup or can be found in your computer’s manual.

### Changing Date and Time in BIOS/UEFI

1. **Navigate to the Date and Time Settings**:
   - Once inside the BIOS/UEFI setup utility, use the arrow keys (or mouse, if supported) to navigate through the menus. Look for options labeled **Standard CMOS Features**, **Main**, **System Configuration**, or similar, depending on your BIOS/UEFI version and manufacturer.
   - Find the date and time settings, which are usually located in one of these sections.

2. **Set the Date and Time**:
   - Select the date field and use the appropriate keys to change the date. This usually involves entering the year, month, and day.
   - Select the time field and adjust the hours, minutes, and seconds.

3. **Save Changes and Exit**:
   - After setting the date and time, navigate to the **Save & Exit** option, which might be labeled **Save Changes and Exit**, **Exit Saving Changes**, or something similar.
   - Confirm your changes when prompted. The system will then restart with the updated date and time.

### Common Steps and Tips

- **Navigating BIOS/UEFI**: Use the arrow keys to move between options, `Enter` to select an option, and `Esc` to go back to the previous menu. Some BIOS/UEFI interfaces might also support mouse input.
- **Manual Reference**: If you’re unsure about the key to press or how to navigate your BIOS/UEFI, refer to your computer’s or motherboard’s manual. Manufacturers often provide specific instructions for accessing and using the BIOS/UEFI.
- **Battery Check**: If the date and time reset every time you restart your computer, the CMOS battery (a small battery on the motherboard that powers the BIOS settings) might need to be replaced.

### Importance of Accurate BIOS/UEFI Time

- **System Logs and Events**: Ensuring accurate time helps maintain proper logs and event timestamps, which are crucial for diagnosing system issues and monitoring activity.
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Many systems and applications rely on the BIOS/UEFI clock to trigger scheduled tasks.
- **Time-Sensitive Applications**: Some applications and services, especially security-related ones, depend on an accurate system clock to function correctly.
- **Network Synchronization**: Proper time settings help in synchronizing the system time with network time servers, ensuring consistency across networked devices.

Changing the date and time in the BIOS/UEFI is a fundamental task that helps maintain system stability and reliability. It’s a straightforward process but important for the overall health and functionality of your computer system.
