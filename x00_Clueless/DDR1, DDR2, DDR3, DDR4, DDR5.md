**DDR** (Double Data Rate) refers to a type of synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM) used in computers and other devices. Each generation of DDR has introduced improvements in speed, bandwidth, and power efficiency. Hereâ€™s a summary of DDR1 through DDR5:

### DDR1 (DDR SDRAM)

- **Introduced**: 2000
- **Data Rate**: Up to 2.1 GB/s
- **Voltage**: 2.5 V
- **Key Features**: The first generation to offer double the data rate compared to SDRAM, transferring data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock cycle.

### DDR2

- **Introduced**: 2003
- **Data Rate**: Up to 4.3 GB/s
- **Voltage**: 1.8 V
- **Key Features**: Improved performance and reduced power consumption compared to DDR1. Also introduced higher density chips.

### DDR3

- **Introduced**: 2007
- **Data Rate**: Up to 17 GB/s
- **Voltage**: 1.5 V (with DDR3L at 1.35 V)
- **Key Features**: Significant increase in speed and bandwidth, along with lower power consumption. Supports larger capacities per module.

### DDR4

- **Introduced**: 2014
- **Data Rate**: Up to 25.6 GB/s
- **Voltage**: 1.2 V
- **Key Features**: Further improvements in speed and energy efficiency. Supports higher module densities and increased overall performance.

### DDR5

- **Introduced**: 2020
- **Data Rate**: Up to 6400 MT/s (and higher in future revisions)
- **Voltage**: 1.1 V
- **Key Features**: Enhanced performance with higher speeds, improved power efficiency, and increased capacity. Features include improved bandwidth and efficiency for better performance in gaming and data-intensive applications.
