Magnetic HDDs, or Hard Disk Drives, are storage devices that use magnetic storage to read and write data. They consist of one or more rotating disks (platters) coated with a magnetic material. Data is written to and read from these platters using read/write heads that move across the surface.

### Key Features:

1. **Storage Capacity**: HDDs are available in various capacities, from hundreds of gigabytes (GB) to several terabytes (TB).

2. **Speed**: They typically have slower access times compared to solid-state drives (SSDs) due to their mechanical components, but they offer good sequential read/write speeds.

3. **Cost**: HDDs are generally more cost-effective for large storage needs compared to SSDs.

4. **Durability**: They are more susceptible to physical shock and damage due to moving parts.

### Common Uses:

- **Personal Computers**: For general storage of files, applications, and operating systems.
- **Servers and Data Centers**: For large-scale storage solutions where high capacity is needed.
- **Backup Solutions**: Often used in external drives for backup purposes.

### Conclusion:

Magnetic HDDs are a reliable and cost-effective option for bulk storage, though SSDs are increasingly favored for speed and durability in many applications.
