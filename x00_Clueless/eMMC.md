**eMMC** (embedded MultiMediaCard) is a type of flash storage used primarily in smartphones, tablets, and low-cost laptops. It integrates the memory chip and controller into a single package, making it compact and cost-effective.

### Key Features:

1. **Integration**: eMMC combines the memory and controller, allowing for simpler design and lower costs.

2. **Performance**: While faster than traditional HDDs, eMMC is generally slower than SSDs, with moderate read/write speeds.

3. **Form Factor**: Typically soldered directly onto the deviceâ€™s motherboard, which limits upgradability.

4. **Capacity**: Available in various capacities, often ranging from 4 GB to 256 GB or more.

### Common Uses:

- **Mobile Devices**: Widely used in smartphones and tablets for app storage and operating systems.
- **Budget Laptops**: Found in low-cost laptops and Chromebooks for basic computing needs.

### Conclusion:

eMMC is a cost-effective solution for devices that require moderate storage performance without the complexity or expense of SSDs.
